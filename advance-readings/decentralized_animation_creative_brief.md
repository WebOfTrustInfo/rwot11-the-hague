# RWOT10 Animation Project
By Erica Connell <minkymu@gmail.com> and Joe Andrieu <joe@legreq.com> 

## Creative Brief
## Goal
The goal of this project is to produce a ~1-minute animation that simply and understandably communicates the relevance of decentralized identity. Working with collaborators from RWOT10, we will develop creative ideas and set the framework for the realization of a brief, stop-motion animated short.

## Background
Erica Connell teaches theater and film classes through her company Wonderland Stage & Screen http://wonderlandstageandscreen.com. She has followed the work of RWOT, as well as W3C VCWG, CCG, and DIDWG since helping coordinate RWOT5 in Santa Barbara. We had an inspiration: if Erica can get eight-year-olds to make a 1-min animation in a ten-week class, we should be able to do something of a similar scope with attendees at an RWOT workshop.This creative brief is our topic paper for consideration at Rebooting the Web of Trust in Buenos Aires. We are looking for like-minded, creative people with great attention to detail and a willingness to collaborate.

## Audience
* CEOs and soccer moms (non-technical decision makers who care more about their world than ours)
* Developers who haven’t yet seen the light
* Regulators, legislators, and legal professionals who need a non-technical “Ah-Ha!” about the why and how of this work.

## Change 
After watching this video, we hope a light bulb will go off in the minds of the audience. They’ll get one or more key elements of why we--as a community--are investing so much time and energy “fixing” digital identity. For some, it will inspire them to get involved in their own way, even if it is simply passing the vision on to others.

## Key characteristics
* Human
* Humorous
* Accessible
* Essential
* Uncomplicated

## Possible Points
* Time is limited, we’ll have to pick and choose.
* Identity is how we recognize, remember, and respond to specific people and things.
* Identity happens. It’s not given to us by a corporation or a government, it’s how we are recognized, remembered, and responded to by our friends, our family, our co-workers, our teachers.
* Identity is a natural and innate phenomenon.
* Identity is inherently personal. It can be both intimate and official, but it is always about “me”.
* States and corporations create mechanisms for recognizing, remembering, and responding to people; these mechanisms are often called an “identity” but they aren’t. That’s a sloppy shorthand that, unfortunately, alienates and oppresses people who deeply understand--often in ways they cannot articulate--that they aren’t defined by those “identities” but rather by their relationships. They are mothers, daughters, sisters, teachers, students, workers, lovers, and more: Momma, honey, Jill, Mrs. President, and ma’am.
* We are more than a number or an identifier.
* Decentralized identity is not about control. It’s about human dignity.
* Identity has _always_ been decentralized. The aberration is the sovereign state and corporations ended up exported their “identities”, allowing others to use, for example, our social security numbers for tracking financial activity. This *accidental* centralization created a lot of value, but also created a lot of problems.

## Possible Pain Points
* Surveillance capitalism
* The unbanked & unidentified
* Tyranny of Data
* Statelessness and refugees
* Loss of self-determination & freedom
* That creepy feeling of being watched and judged and tracked

## Possible Key Phrases
* Identity is how we recognize, remember, and respond to specific people and things.
* Decentralized identity is about human dignity.
* Don’t tell me who I am!
* It doesn’t have to be this way. It can be better.
* I just wanna be me.

## Key Imagery
* Everyday person / kid / woman. NOT A GEEK. A typical “girl next door” (of any gender).
* Everyday life experiences. Everyday moments.
* Diversity. Not just a white male in a 3 bedroom home with a white picket fence, a sports car, and a white collar job in a high-rise.
* “Normal” in the sense that anyone watching it can empathize with the characters and their lives.

## Call to Action
* We’ll have to pick a limited set, but here are some ideas:
* Call your senator
* Clean up your online shit (quit facebook, etc.)
* Pay attention to your online exposure
* Protect your self
* Challenge the status quo
* Shift your expectations
* Demand more
* Don’t give up
* Write some code
* Write some letters
* Write an article
* Come to Rebooting
* Do something
* Make some art

## Process
The group will use the above framework to explore the creative development process that has proven effective in Wonderland’s classes.

* We start with developing characters and story ideas.
* We will then create a storyboard, noting media (clay, construction paper, toys, google eyes, pipe cleaner, fabric, etc). 
* We will develop a working script, and possibly a draft recording for audio. 
* We will explore scenery, props and actual character creation in desired media. 
* Actual shooting and recording the video will occur after the workshop.
